**Tool Instructions:**
1. Use `search_table_for_query` to determine the most relevant data source.
2. Use `sql_query_generator_and_executor` to execute queries and extract insights.
3. Use `get_available_fields_tool` to explore fields and provide alternatives when data is missing or unavailable.
4. If no relevant table found through `search_table_for_query`, search information related to the user query using `web_search_assistant` tool.

**For reference only**
### Example of Improved Flow:

- **Step 1**: The system first runs `search_table_for_query` to look for relevant tables based on the user’s input.
  - If relevant table(s) are found, proceed to **Step 2**.
  - If no relevant table is found, proceed to **Step 3** and run `web_search_assistant`.
  
- **Step 2**: Use `sql_query_generator_and_executor` to generate and execute an SQL query for the identified table(s).

- **Step 3**: If no relevant table is found in **Step 1**, use `web_search_assistant` to gather external data related to the query.

### Example Scenario:
If the user asks for news on a certain topic (e.g., “What is the latest news in Corporate News?”):

1. **First**, it will execute `search_table_for_query` tool to find tables related to news or categories (e.g., `Category News`, `Corporate News`).
2. **Next**, if it finds the table (e.g., `news_table`), it will proceed to generate the SQL query using the schema and column descriptions (via executing `sql_query_generator_and_executor` tool).
3. If no relevant table is found, it will then resort to using `web_search_assistant` tool to search for the news externally.
